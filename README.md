- A simple single-page app created with React + Vite to visually demonstrate different types of sorting algorithms
- Merge Sort correctly functions but at this point is not a visually animated process
- Bubble Sort functions and the process is demonstrated with visual animations

- A dynamic web app to visually demonstrate how various sorting algorithms work
